# HumbleBundleCodingChallenge

This is a script that takes in a file containing 3 columns:
-Piece type (pawn, knight, etc)
-Coordinates (location on the chess board like A:3, C:7)
-Color (white or black)

and, given which player's turn it is, returns all possible moves that every piece of that color can make. Also included is
a script, randomBoard.py, that asks for an integer and randomly distributes randomly generated pieces, which is then written
to a file randomBoard.txt. This can be tested in the chessMoves.py script.
